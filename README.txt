Desc: This webapp is to help users see all the events that are happening at all parks in their city. I created this app due to a problem I faced when I was younger. Everytime I wanted to go to the basketball, the towns moms would be practicing their zoomba dancing. Now nothing agaist people exercising but they would always be doing their dance on the basketball court which meant I couldnt play there. If I had access to this webapp. Then assuming the zoomba moms created an event at the park they were practicing then I would be able to see, "oh they are praciticing today, I will save my time and not go".
